                <p>A great deal of geographic data is none of the above - instead of being composed of the numbers that computers understand, it is stored as text data - references to placenames, streets, addresses, and so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t directly mappable. Due to variance in naming and the many definitions of place, there&#39;s an indirect and often inaccurate process involved in transforming the words &#39;United States&#39; into the point <code>-120, 40</code>. This process is what we call <strong>geocoding</strong>.</p>
<p>The opposite process is <strong>reverse geocoding</strong>, where the readily available data is precise geographic positions, and the objective is a human description, like <code>United States</code> or <code>1714 14th Street</code>. Likewise, this isn&#39;t always accurate - one place one earth can be inside of overlapping and conflicting boundaries or between address points.</p>
<p>Geocoding and reverse geocoding can be very tricky: coordinate position errors, poorly formatted address data, and an ever-changing grid of streets and buildings contribute to the difficulty in turning addresses into coordinates, or vice versa.</p>
