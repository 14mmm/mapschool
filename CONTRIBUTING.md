# Concept

`mapschool` is an introduction to geospatial and map concepts. It is not a guide to specific software, and is unconcerned with busywork and historical notes. It is an introduction that covers as much of the field as possible, without attempting to define every term and explain everything.

It is written for a high-school reading level and tries not to rely on deep knowledge of any other domain.

Prior art is maintained in the `SEEALSO.md` document alongside `mapschool`. Cross-references, if any, should be recorded in this document.

# Practical

`mapschool` is a single page document maintained as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It should be readily accessible as a web page, but should also be understandable in full as a printout or PDF; that is, it does not rely on dynamic examples or hyperlinks.

The structure of the document is defined by headings, which range from `h1` to `h4`. The fifth heading, `h5`, is a special case: `h5` sections are considered 'additional reading' and may be hidden and toggled by web interfaces.

# Purpose

`mapschool` is designed for self-learners and usable for traditional classroom experiences and industry. To make this possible, it is a free document under a Creative Commons License. In practical terms for this project, that means that printouts, re-publication, adaptations into product manuals, and any other creative usage is permitted, as long as attribution - a reference back to `mapschool` - is given.

# Translation

We love translations, and are keeping it simple for now. While `mapschool` is maintained in American English as `README.md`, please add translations as `README.language.md`, preferably using a [standard language subtag](http://people.w3.org/rishida/utils/subtags/).
